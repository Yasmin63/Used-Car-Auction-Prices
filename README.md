# Used-Car-Auction-Prices

## Introduction
The final project of Data Science Bootcamp Batch 36 at Rakamin Academy. In this project, as a Data Scientist from a used car dealership company in the United States has the responsibility to provide price recommendations in dealing with existing problems through machine learning. The following is the dataset used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices.


## Problem Statement
- The company wants to increase profits and car sales, because the current condition is not optimal.
current condition is not optimal.
- Profits are not yet optimal because the car appraisal process is not efficient cost and time, also the price is not yet objective for sellers and buyers, which has an impact on company profits that impact on company profits.


## Goal
Increase car sales profit with cost efficiency and favorable price


## Objective
- Create a model that can predict used car prices automatically and recommend a favorable based on the specifications and condition of the unit
- It is expected that this model can make the appraisal process more efficient, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction. efficient, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.


## Business Metrics
- Number of cars successfully appraised in one day
- Sales profit from recommendation result price


## Stage
In this project, we divide into 4 stages:

Stage 1 - Preparation: We learn about the project and dataset that has been choosen. The key-takeaways in this stage is who we are in this project, the problem statement, goal and objective that we want to achieve and the last is business metrics.
Stage 2 - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): We explore the dataset to understand the characteristics of the data. This process is divided into 3 steps, starting from Descriptive Statistics, EDA, and gathering insights related to the dataset with visualizations.
Stage 3 - Pre-Processing: We handle the data to make it clean before starting the modeling process. This cleaning process includes handling missing values, duplicate data, outliers, and feature engineering.
Stage 4 - Supervised Learning: We enter the modelling process and explore several algorithm to enhance based on feature and target that we been choosed.
